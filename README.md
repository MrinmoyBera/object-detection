# Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV and TensorFlow

## Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection system using OpenCV and a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The system uses a webcam to capture live video feed and detect objects in the frame, displaying the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using a webcam.
- Detection of multiple object categories based on the COCO dataset.
- Display of bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

## Model
The object detection model used in this project is a pre-trained TensorFlow model with weights and configuration files. The model is capable of detecting various objects from the COCO dataset.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
